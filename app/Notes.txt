1.  by default the pages or the component we create are
    render using server side

2.  if you wish to render the component by client side 
    then you can write "use client" at the tocomponent

3.  using states or any other hook or client side management
    the declare the component as client side component

4.  Data fetching
    1.  server side rendering (SSR) 
        ->  fetch the data every single call
    2.  static side generation (SSG)
        ->  store the data in cache and used it
    3.  incremental static rendering (ISR)
        ->  combination of above two
        ->  we can provide the additonal parameter 
            revalidate to store the data for the
            perticular interval of time
    *   By default Nexjs use static side generation for data fetching
